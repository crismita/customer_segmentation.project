Customer segmentation using K-Means clustering to group customers based on their purchasing behaviour used for targeted marketing and business insights



# Customer Segmentation Using Machine Learning

##  Project Overview
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into distinct groups based on similar characteristics.  
In this project, I used machine learning techniques to segment customers based on their behavioral and demographic data.  
This helps businesses understand customer patterns and target them more effectively.

---

##  Objective
- Identify different customer segments
- Understand customer behavior patterns
- Help businesses improve marketing strategies and customer retention

---

##  Machine Learning Approach
- Unsupervised Learning
- K-Means Clustering algorithm

---

##  Dataset Description
The dataset contains customer-related features such as:
- Age
- Income
- Total Spending Score
- Number of Web Purchases
- Number of Store Purchases
- Number of Web visits per month
- Recency

*(Dataset used only for learning and project demonstration purposes)*
